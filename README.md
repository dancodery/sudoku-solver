## Documentation

The program is based on the Udacity.com Nanodegree Program 'Artificial Intelligence'.

In the highest level of solving the sudoku it uses depth-first search and propagation to try all possible values. 
But it is not just brute forcing all possible values. It begins to be more sophisticated in the lower levels.
